Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
	In this project, the goal was to make a program that would receive inputs of investments, interest and length of time, and then make some caluclation with that data using the compounding interest formula. From there it displays the information in 3 seperate columns. The first display is without additional monthly payments and the second display is with attintional monthly payments.

What did you do particularly well?
	Making it easy to enter the required information and displaying the output in nest columns is the best part.
	
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
	Some things I would do different to make it more efficient would be to only require a second keystroke to exit after the confirmation question instead of reuring entering in another character. Also maybe have at the top of the columns sections that displays the total investment at full term.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
	The most challenging part of this project was formatting the columns to all be even as the numbers kepts getting bigger. I accomplished that through a little trial and error. I would re-run the program after each change to see how the output was formatted as needed.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
	Working with classes and formation text in columns. the lessons learn from this also helped me in project 3.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Making the bulk of the code either in its own class or method, using a naming convention for varibles that are intuitive for the purpse of the program.
